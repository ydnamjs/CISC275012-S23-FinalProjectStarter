Persona 1: I am a father of three boys who love playing and watching sports all the time. It's a daily thing!
We generally play/watch basketball, football, and baseball. These kids are always breaking something! Whether it be a new
baseball bat, a new basketball, or a new football, we always buy stuff for sports. Recently, we've been using Amazon but
their customer service and website have been particularly slow and stale! Basically, what we want out of a good website is one where we can just shop quickly, efficiently, and the interface and webpage is stylish. I've taught my boys to be patient but man, lately Amazon has not been very time friendly to us!
